# :v: Welcome :v:

Thank you very much for taking the time and partiicpating in the challenge for the role of Lead User Experience Designer with us at azeti. 

# :alarm_clock: Logistics and Expectations

We know that you'd be using your precious free time to work on this challenge and therefore we want to set clear expectations to ensure that your time is spent reasonably and to avoid that you waste or invest too much. Again we appreciate you participating.

__How much time should i spend?__

_A resonable amount of time is a couple of hours, most probably less than half a day._

__How do you evaluate the result?__

_We will not grade or evaluate based on quantity but on quality. We'd invite you to present your results to our team which is a great chance to meet your (potential) new colleagues._

__Is this a design challenge where i am expected to work for free?__

_No, it's not a classical redesign of App XYZ, it is a mix of hands-on design challenge and leadership/presentation tasks. You still own the results of it and can reuse it in your CV as long as there is no confidential data (i.e. numbers, values) included._

__Where can i find the screencast?__

_The screencast that is subject of the challenge will be sent to you separately to download and we will provide time codes so you can skip the boring parts :wink:_

__How can i submit my results?__

_You can (no must) send us your results beforehand via email. Please respond to the previous conversations so we can relate it to your application. Ultimately we'd schedule a presentation with you where you'd walk us through your apporoach to the challenge and present what you've did. The presentation will take 60 to 90 minutes._

__What is expected in the presentation?__

_You'll become our Lead UX designer and we're by no means as seasoned in UX as you are. Therefore we look forward to you to walking us through your results, explain your thought process and ultimately show off your skills._

# :trophy: Challenge

The challenge consists of two sections: _Design_ and _Methods_ which both have to be worked on. You are given options in each section so pick the one that suits you best :wink:. Please start by reading the story

## :blue_book: Story

Our customer is using an inhouse developed software tool for managing and controlling their manufacturing. No one ever thought about user experience and this is reflected in the current UI. Users are unengaged and frustrated by it. azeti is tasked to develop a brand new version of it that avoids all the issues of the previous tool. We're going to develop is as our new product and shift away from an inhouse-tool that doesn't follow good standards and qualities a product would.
You'll be given a screencast that was recorded during a meeting where one of the main developers is walking us through a portion of the tool how it's used. The screencast is the base for the challenge and all tasks will relate to it. 
We'll provide a lsit of time codes so you know where in the video the interesting sections are, i.e. demo of how they report data or how users can create new views. 

_Please watch the video sections: <TODO>_ for a base understanding of it.
