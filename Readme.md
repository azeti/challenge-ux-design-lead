# :v: Welcome :v:

Thank you very much for taking the time and partiicpating in the challenge for the role of Lead User Experience Designer with us at azeti. 

# :alarm_clock: Logistics and Expectations

We know that you'd be using your precious free time to work on this challenge and therefore we want to set clear expectations to ensure that your time is spent reasonably and to avoid that you waste or invest too much. Again we appreciate you participating.

__How much time should i spend?__

_A resonable amount of time is a couple of hours, most probably less than half a day._

__How do you evaluate the result?__

_We will not grade or evaluate based on quantity but on quality. We'd invite you to present your results to our team which is a great chance to meet your (potential) new colleagues._

__Is this a design challenge where i am expected to work for free?__

_No, it's not a classical redesign of App XYZ, it is a mix of hands-on design challenge and leadership/presentation tasks. You still own the results of it and can reuse it in your CV as long as there is no confidential data (i.e. numbers, values) included._

__Where can i find the screencast?__

_The screencast that is subject of the challenge will be sent to you separately to download and we will provide time codes so you can skip the boring parts :wink:_

__How can i submit my results?__

_You can (no must) send us your results beforehand via email. Please respond to the previous conversations so we can relate it to your application. Ultimately we'd schedule a presentation with you where you'd walk us through your apporoach to the challenge and present what you've did. The presentation will take 60 to 90 minutes._

__What is expected in the presentation?__

_You'll become our Lead UX designer and we're by no means as seasoned in UX as you are. Therefore we look forward to you to walking us through your results, explain your thought process and ultimately show off your skills._

# :blue_book: Story

Our customer is using an inhouse developed software tool for managing and controlling their manufacturing. User experience is very bad and this is reflected in the current UI. Users are unengaged and frustrated by it. azeti is tasked to develop a new version from scratch that comes with great user experience from day one. We're going to develop this as a new product and shift away from an inhouse-tool that doesn't follow good standards and qualities a product would.
You'll be given a screencast that was recorded during a meeting where one of the main developers is walking us through a portion of the tool and its usage. __The screencast is the base for the challenge and all tasks will relate to it.__
We'll provide a lsit of time codes of the video so you're able to identify the interesting sections, i.e. demo of how they report data or how users can create new views.

# :trophy: Challenge

The challenge consists of two sections: _Design_ and _Methods_ which both have to be worked on. Please start by reading the story.

## :wrench: Hands-on _Design_

Choose either of the two tasks below to work on.

a) Please choose one user interface screen from the Screencast and create a proposal (i.e. Sketch, Wireframe, Mock-up) how the screen and it's components could be re-arranged to increase usability.

b) Please choose one component (i.e. _Functions_ Menu, Table Views with Filters, Drop-down Menus in Screens, New Window with Form) from the shown user interface and redesign (low-fidelity Mock-Up or similar) it in order to increase usability.

## :mortar_board: _Methods_ & Workflow

Developing a new version of shown Manufacturing Software is a big challenge. Plenty of UI and UX flaws are obvious and a lot of work is ahead of us. 

Please present to us how you would tackle such a big challenge. Your presentation could be of any form (Word, Miro, Markup Document, Powerpoint, Mural Board, Live Pen & Paper with Post-Its, Trello, textfile, ...) you like and that suits your known workflow.

__Some key questions to consider:__
How would you tackle such a challenge, organise your team and work, collaborate with developers and users?
What are key tasks and milestones for such a big project from UX perspective (assume the PO helps you understand requirements and refines the backlog)?
How would you structure the work of the UX team (Caroline, Junior UX Designer and yourself)?
What methods would you embrace for such an agile project?
How do you ensure an agile workflow with frequent (daily/weekly) tests and short feedback loops?
How do you measure your UX teams success in the project?

__What's given:__
* Dedicated Product Owner is on board and handles backlog and all user stories
* PO will require support from UX to bring ideas quickly to live and communicate ideas to users and stakeholders
* Development team consists of 6-7 dedicated Fullstack Developers
* UI will be enirely web based, support multiple languages and should run on common platforms (Desktop --> Mobile)
* Dev team uses SCRUM
* Main development starts September '21 and runs agile for 2 years, releases will be done often (every sprint, ultimately continously) and with small increments
* Key users are identified and available every two weeks to review ideas
* Green field development, no UX work has been done so far

__What we expect:__
This challenge is not about answering 100% of the questions and providing tremendous detail but to show off how you work and how you structure your work within your team. We want to get an idea how a professional like you helps us handling such a big challenge.
__We will not evaluate by quantity of your results but by quality and how you present your results.__ We expect you to argue why you chose certain ways and what's your reasoning behind your answers and approaches to these tasks.
